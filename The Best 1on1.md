###Possible flow:

1. The review of last week

	+ What what went wrong?
		+ Why?
	+ What went well?
		+ Why

2. The plan for next week.

	+ What we need to get done next week?
	+ What if anything is threading or blocking that?

3. The motivation for the next week
	+ How do these tasks play into the bigger picture?
